        THE LAST STRAW[G]
        
             TIME: _The present day._
        
             SCENE: _The basement of a large apartment-house in New York City._
        
             SCENE: _The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
             Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
             above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
             door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
             back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
             broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
             front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
             telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
             vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
             sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
             the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
             chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
             and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
             calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: a
             little before noon. The telephone rings_; MRS. BAUER _leaves her
             ironing and goes to answer it_.<br>
            <br>
 MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
[MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.  BAUER'S _door and looks in_.<br>
<br>     
LANE. Say--where's the boss?<br>
<br>
MRS. BAUER. He'll be home soon, I--hope--Jim. What you want?
     [_He stands looking at her with growing sympathy._<br>
<br>
LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of
groceries for Sawyers.<br>
<br>
MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop
which hangs beside the door._] Here.<br>
<br>
LANE. What's the matter?<br>
<br>
MRS. BAUER. [_Dully._] Huh?
