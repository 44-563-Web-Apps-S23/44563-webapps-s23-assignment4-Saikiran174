            <p> SCENE: _The kitchen of the Bauer flat in the basement of the Bryn
             Mawr. A window at the side gives on an area and shows the walk
             above and the houses across the street. Opposite the windows is a
             door to an inner room. Through the outer door, in the centre of the
             back wall, a dumb-waiter and whistles to tenants can be seen. A
             broken milk-bottle lies in a puddle of milk on the cement floor in
             front of the dumb-waiter. To the right of the outer door, a
             telephone; gas-range on which there are flat-irons heating and
             vegetables cooking. To the left of the outer door is an old
             sideboard; over it hangs a picture of Schiller. Near the centre of
             the room, a little to the right, stands a kitchen table with four
             chairs around it. Ironing-board is placed between the kitchen table
             and the sink, a basket of dampened clothes under it. A large
             calendar on the wall. An alarm-clock on the window-sill. Time: 
             little before noon. The telephone rings_; MRS. BAUER _leaves her
             ironing and goes to answer it_.</p><br>
